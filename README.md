# Cafe & WiFi REST API
Cafe & WiFi is a RESTful API, which allows users to search for cafes to remote-work from.

The user can use the HTTP GET request to:
- Search for all cafes on the database;
- Search for a single random cafe to go to; and
- Search for cafes by location.

The API also gives authorised users with a valid API-Key the ability to:
- Add new cafes to the database using a POST request;
- Update the price of black coffee using a PATCH request; and
- Report a cafe as closed by deleting it from the database, using the DELETE request.
