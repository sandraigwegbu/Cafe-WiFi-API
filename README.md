# Cafe & WiFi REST API
The Cafe &amp; WiFi API allows users to search for cafes to remote-work from. The user can search for all cafes on the database, search for a random cafe to go to, and search for cafes by location. The API also gives authorised users the ability to post new cafes to the database, update the price of black coffee, and to report a cafe as closed by deleting it from the database.
